    <h1>The Sun on my Fridge</h1>
    <h2>By Emiliano Elizalde</h2>
    <p>This story is about finding inspiration. The protagonist is going thruogh art block but finds something that sucks him in and inspires him to make art again. I made this because I felt inspired by a painting of a furnace. To me, the message is that inspiration can come in the weirdest ways, you just have to be ready to channel it into good work.</p>
